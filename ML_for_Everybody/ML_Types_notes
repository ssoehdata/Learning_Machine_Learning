AI - a domain of computing whose goal is  to perform human-like tasks and simulate human behaviour.

ML - a subset of AI (subdomain) that uses algorithms to learn from data with explicit programming. (Explicit Programming).

Data Science -  a field that attempts to find patterns and draw insights from data.

Types of ML:

1) Supervised Learning: 
- uses labeled inputs (i.e. the input has a corresponding output label) 
   to train models and learn outputs. 

    Examples of Supervised Learning (a: Classification(defined labels) 
                                     b: Regression (no labels defined)

        Some common Supervised ML algorithms: 
                (linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, 
                 random forests, SVM's(support vector machines),
                  KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Gradient Boosting

2) Unsupervised Learning: 
    - Use unlabled data to learn about patterns in the data. 

    - 3 main types (Clustering, Associative Learning, Dimensionality Reduction)

      Some common Clustering Algorithms: (K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering,
                                           Density-Based Clustering[DBSCAN],
                                           Mean-Shift Clustering, Spectral Clustering.

     Some common Algo's for Associative Clustering: 
                    (Apriori Algorithm, FP-Growth Algorithm, Eclat Algorithm,
                    Efficient Tree-based Algorithms)


    Some common methods for Dimensionality Reduction: 
                    PCA(Principle Component Analysis),
                    LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis)
                    LLE(Locally Linear Embedding)

3) Reinforcement Learning
        - agent learning in interactive environment abased on rewards and penalties.

        Two main types (Positive and Negative Reinforcement Learning)
